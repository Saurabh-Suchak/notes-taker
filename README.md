# notes-taker

### Description and Features

<!-- You can create multiple notes with the help of this project. 
It is made using Javascript and has a clean and simple UI. -->
This is a simple notes taking web app where user can take down **multiple notes in markdown**. It is made to cater the need of people , most likely students to take down important notes or points and have them all in one place. <br>
The user has **3 options** , he can either:<br>
1. Preview the notes.
2. Edit them.
3. Delete the notes.

The most **useful feature** is that even if the user reloads the web app or even close the tab and open it again, the notes made would be **stored** and **not get deleted**. 

### New Things Implemented / Learnt 
- Manipulating the HTML elements using the innerHTML property of HTML DOM.
- Using JSON to make the object that can be used in the program using JSON.parse and also converting the objects into JSON string using the JSON.stringify property
- To make the web app more useful it was important to find a way to save the content for future use so the localStorage property allows to save the content even if the brower window is closed.
